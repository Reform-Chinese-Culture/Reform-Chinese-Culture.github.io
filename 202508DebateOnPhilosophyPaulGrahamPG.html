      <h2 id="graham-against-philosophy">Graham against philosophy</h2>
      <p>In the polemic against the status quo philosophy, Paul Graham
      cited “confusion of words” as a significant issue. “Do we have
      free will? Depends <em>[sic]</em> what you mean by ‘free.’ Do
      abstract ideas exist? Depends <em>[sic]</em> what you mean by
      ‘exist.’” He then lauded Wittgenstein’s approach to defining the
      language, but lamented that philosophy is still bogged down in
      essays of words of indeterminate meaning. He argues that
      philosophy is much like mathematics, albeit with a different
      medium. On the one hand is mathematics operating on precisely
      defined terms, and on the other is philosophy.</p>
      <p>Graham laments that the discipline doesn’t pursue
      <em>useful</em> knowledge. Here, partly in parallel to
      mathematics, he argues that philosophy is disingenuous in claiming
      that philosophy should pursue knowledge of no practical use, being
      the supposedly more noble goal. He remarked that this shields the
      discipline from criticism when it doesn’t bear useful fruit.
      Furthermore, he argues that Aristotle and his tutelage pursued it
      in the completely wrong direction:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>[H]e sets as his goal in the Metaphysics the exploration of
      knowledge that has no practical use. Which means no alarms go off
      when he takes on grand but vaguely understood questions and ends
      up getting lost in a sea of words.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He said that the motive to pursue uselessness is different from
      the result of being useless. E.g., he cited number theory as a
      pursuit of useless knowledge that turns out to be quite useful.
      However, in claiming this, it is unclear why the intention to
      pursue useless knowledge will <em>inevitably</em> lead to
      knowledge that is useless. Graham didn’t explain how the intention
      will inevitably lead to the result. In fact, number theory is a
      counterexample to Graham’s blanket statement. Furthermore,
      Graham’s argument that the pursuit of uselessness shields
      philosophers is valid <em>only when</em> philosophy is useless.
      Somers later attacks this point.</p>
      <p>Graham also gives an interesting interpretation of the
      philosophy scholarship. He conceptualizes two kinds of people: (1)
      people who deem philosophy a waste of time will study other
      subjects; (2) people who can’t tell the difference between
      justifiably difficult things (e.g., mathematics) and unjustifiably
      difficult things (e.g., philosophical word salad), as he
      writes:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Curiously, however, the works they produced continued to
      attract new readers. Traditional philosophy occupies a kind of
      singularity in this respect. If you write in an unclear way about
      big ideas, you produce something that seems tantalizingly
      attractive to inexperienced but intellectually ambitious students.
      Till one knows better, it’s hard to distinguish something that’s
      hard to understand because the writer was unclear in his own mind
      from something like a mathematical proof that’s hard to understand
      because the ideas it represents are hard to understand. To someone
      who hasn’t learned the difference, traditional philosophy seems
      extremely attractive: as hard (and therefore impressive) as math,
      yet broader in scope. That was what lured me in as a high school
      student.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>While his account of the vicious cycle of philosophy
      scholarship reads convincing, it is unfortunately predicated on
      his previous argument that philosophy is really useless—nothing
      more than word salads. How did he reach that conclusion? He
      evaluated it more on its lack of utility, i.e., “the pursuit of
      useless knowledge.”</p>
      <p>What’s the solution? Graham’s focus is on the test of
      utility:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>The test of utility I propose is whether we cause people who
      read what we’ve written to do anything differently afterward.
      Knowing we have to give definite (if implicit) advice will keep us
      from straying beyond the resolution of the words we’re using.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As we’ll see later, Somers has two responses to why philosophy
      and the so-called word salads meet the test of utility.</p>
      <p>Instead of looking for the most generalized principles
      regardless of their utility, like Aristotle, Graham works
      backwards. He instead looks within only the useful things, the
      most generalized principles. Unfortunately, this doesn’t criticize
      philosophy meaningfully—his own test of utility seemed to have
      been met since Aristotle’s times. He overlooked how ancient Greek
      political philosophy deeply influenced the foundation of democracy
      and the Western democratic tradition that we have today, and how
      philosophy about G-d<span
      class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
      class="sidenote">In Judaism, G-d is sometimes not fully spelled so
      as not to desecrate the name. As in Talmud (Shevuot 35a), “One who
      erases even a single letter of the Divine Name is liable.”<br />
      <br />
      </span></span> influenced Roman Catholicism. He himself concedes
      the influence of contemporary philosophy (e.g., controlled
      experiment) in the 20th century.</p>
      <p>After all, did Graham really prove his ambitious claim? I’d say
      no. Graham didn’t fulfill his fundamental burden of proving that
      philosophy is useless. In fact, history shows the philosophy has
      met the test of utility quite frequently ever since Aristotle.</p>
      <p>Implicit in Graham’s analysis is the natural evolution of a
      discipline. He praised Aristotle as the first people to think
      about abstract problems: “People talk so much about abstractions
      now that we don’t realize what a leap it must have been when they
      [Aristotle et al.] first started to” (comment added). It is
      natural that a discipline in its infancy bears little value
      centuries later, especially with a subject as ambitious and
      generalized as philosophy. Graham’s critique is just as apt for
      early philosophy as just about every discipline: early
      mathematics, early physics, early biology, etc. In fact,
      philosophy might even deserve a bit more time and patience as it’s
      more extensive, generalized, and universal than the other
      disciplines.</p>
      <h2 id="somers-for-philosophy">Somers for philosophy</h2>
      <p>Somers started with listing the utility that Douglas
      Hofstadter, John Searle, etc., contribute to modern society. He
      then proceeded to defend the use of seemingly vague language. Even
      a seemingly trivial investigation on the word “I” can lead to
      interesting thoughts:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Thus, a petty semantic question—what is the meaning of the word
      “I”?—can open up a deeper line of inquiry: how do we form an
      integrated sense of self, why do we even have a word like “I,”
      when our brain is apparently just a soup of meaningless symbols?
      That is a question that, once articulated properly, can be
      explored by philosophers and scientists alike. (See Hofstadter’s
      “Who Shoves Whom Around Inside the Careenium?, or, The Meaning of
      the Word ‘I’” for one such exploration.)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>“Word-wrestling” even has some practical utility in law, a
      fundamental element of our society:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>[W]resting imprecise words out of their natural context and
      plugging them into a perverted formalism is the law as we know
      it—it’s practically the whole game. We don’t attack it, though,
      because we know that their “language-games” help to draw
      increasingly fine lines around difficult ideas—to, as it were,
      measure the coast of Britain. I think the same should be said of
      philosophy.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Further to arguing that pontificating upon complex words is
      useful for self-inquiry, Somers cited other examples to show that
      such word complexity is necessary. Much like the Stokes’ Theorem,
      a mathematical theorem, a complicatedly worded sentence in
      philosophy embeds meaning that should be read beyond its <em>prima
      facie</em> impression. People don’t criticize the use of
      complicated words like “oriented smooth manifold” or “partition of
      unity” because they don’t assume such terms are useless even if
      they don’t understand them. In the same logic, one shouldn’t
      assume that <em>mutual historicization</em> or <em>postmodern
      theory</em> are useless because they don’t understand history and
      literature. The same logic for mathematics applies to
      philosophy.</p>
      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In sum, it seems that Graham went too far with his claim that
      philosophy in the status quo is useless. It could instead be
      viewed as a natural progression that starts from being useless,
      much like how, before astronomy, there was astrology. Somers
      offered a good list of the usefulness of modern philosophy. Somers
      also explains the necessity of the so-called word salad, likening
      it to the use of complex mathematical terms.</p>
      <p>Turns out a word salad is just as healthy as a green salad
      after all.</p>
