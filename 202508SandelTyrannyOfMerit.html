      <ol>
      <li><p>Old Catholic tradition of salvation by work: there was a
      connection between work and deserving reward.</p></li>
      <li><p>Protestant Reformation sustained the work ethic.</p>
      <ol>
      <li><p>Calvinism, by predeterminism, inevitably encouraged this
      mindset.</p></li>
      </ol></li>
      <li><p>In modern U.S. times:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><p>U.S. presidents increasingly use language such as “the
      …that you <em>deserve</em>,” or “on the right side of
      history.”</p></li>
      <li><p>Martin Luther King, Jr.: “[T]he arc of the moral universe
      is long, but it bends toward justice.”</p></li>
      <li><p>Ivy League graduates increasingly fill cabinet appointments
      (e.g., Obama’s well-credentialed cabinet ministers), leading to
      apathy against the white working class; hence the Trumpian

      <h3 id="economic-theories-of-merit">Economic Theories of
      Merit</h3>
      <ol>
      <li><p>Hayek’s free-market liberalism: reward is not based on
      merit, but on the manipulation of the market and reflective of
      market values (<em>wants</em> or <em>desires</em>).</p></li>
      <li><p>Rawls’ welfare-state liberalism: accepts reward based on
      market values instead of merit, but emphasizes redistribution
      because the ability to accrue market values is unearned.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>Example: born disabled, or born to excel in martial arts in
      a society that only values literary skills.</p></li>
      <li><p>Redistribution, however, makes poor people receiving
      government transfers feel unworthy.</p></li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><p>Frank Knight’s critique of equating market values with
      merit/deservingness: e.g., inventing an addictive drug provides
      for market wants and accrues value, but is not deserving.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>In fact, the people satisfying undeserving market wants
      (drugs, gambling) may be the very ones creating them.</p></li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><p>Luck egalitarianism: defends inequalities that arise from
      effort and choice. This highlights a point of convergence with
      free-market liberalism.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Sandel claims that all theories in (1)–(4) lead to meritocratic
      hubris.</p>
      <h3 id="the-harms-of-meritocracy">The Harms of Meritocracy</h3>
      <ol>
      <li><p>Harmful for poor individuals: psychological effects of
      being told their “non-deservingness” is due to forces outside
      their control.</p></li>
      <li><p>Harmful for society: meritocratic hubris from top earners
      and the privileged.</p></li>
      <li><p>No dignity of work: even when poor Americans receive
      payouts, they suffer blows to self-esteem when dependent on
      government help.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="my-comments">My Comments</h2>
      <p>Sandel correctly observes the woes of the white working class
      in the U.S. However, he incorrectly attributed it to the rise of
      meritocracy. And he didn’t prove why meritocracy is harmful in the
      first place.</p>
      <p>Even three-quarters into the book, Sandel seems merely to be
      ranting about the rise of meritocracy and expecting readers to
      decide whether it is good or bad. Furthermore, the examples he
      constantly cites centres on the dissatisfaction of the white
      working class. What about Black and Latino Americans? Asian
      Americans? American Jews? These groups cannot be ignored,
      especially when affirmative action increasingly puts them under
      the spotlight.</p>
      <p>To give him some fair credit, Sandel raised a good question
      about the white working class (WWC). He correctly attributed many
      of their woes to globalization and an economy mercilessly leaving
      people without technical skills behind. But what is the diagnosis?
      He argues that meritocracy is rising and is to blame for the woes
      of the white working class whose jobs are disappearing into the
      fast pace of globalization.</p>
      <p>His main argument against meritocracy is psychological. But the
      argument that meritocracy causes poor Americans psychological harm
      is too intangible to prove and borders on socialism. First, why
      does wealth always lead to hubris? What about Bill Gates and
      others active in philanthropy? What about <em>noblesse
      oblige</em>? Even the meritocratic religions Sandel cites (e.g.,
      Catholicism) emphasize charity. A survey (e.g., Pew) of top 10%
      attitudes toward the poor would be more concrete. Second, why is
      receiving help necessarily harmful for self-esteem? Why can’t it
      instead rebuild dignity and enable a middle-class life under
      globalization? If receiving redistribution is always harmful,
      Sandel seems to argue for eliminating wealth differences
      altogether. Only then would redistribution be unnecessary. Under
      this stringent constraint of Sandel, it’s hard to see any other
      alternatives than socialism that do not harm the dignity of work
      and the self-esteem of the poor white working class.</p>
      <p>Even if Sandel does not explicitly endorse socialism, he
      underplays how market economies invigorate innovation to level up
      the living standards for all. The proper test would be a
      controlled experiment that asks: what helps the bottom 20% more in
      these two scenarios?</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>Economy (A): income based on contributions, satisfying
      wants, or merit.</p></li>
      <li><p>Economy (B): welfare market economy (status quo).</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Such a question is worth investigating: even some may argue
      that the US market economy has been more inequal in wealth, the
      economy could lift <em>everyone</em> up so fast that even the
      bottom 20% got a huge living standards boost. For example, Economy
      (B) could level up the living standards by 500% in 10 years,
      giving a 1000% boost to the top 20% and a 200% boost to the bottom
      20%. At the same time, because Economy (B) has no incentives for
      engineers for better fridges, cars, trains to innovate, it
      uniformly levels up everyone by 100%, less than the 200% in
      (A).</p>
      <p>To be sure, Economy (A) has never existed in real life. So
      whatever comparisons we’re making only exist in theory. Sandel
      didn’t do anything to prove why Economy (A), in theory, is better.
      Even if Sandel were to succeed at proving the benefits of (A),
      there’s another question that’s outstanding: how to reach (A)?</p>
      <p>Attempts to establish an Economy (A) in the Soviet Union,
      China, North Korea, Cuba, and some parts of Israel have either
      failed or perverted to be something else. But it is simply
      dangerous for Sandel to either ignore this argument, or to argue
      for the establishment of an Economy (A). This is important:
      because there’ve been so many failed attempts to establish an
      alternative to the market economy, any theorie is dubious if it
      argues for its benefit <em>before</em> even discussing the
      establishing process itself. You can’t just advocate that Mars is
      a better planet to live onyou have to establish the feasibility of
      moving to Mars first.</p>
      <p>In sum, Sandel asked a great question about the poor whites (no
      other poor Americans are included in the book), while giving an
      answer to neither the poor whites nor the poor Americans as a
      whole. Reading this book against meritocracy ultimately makes me
      want to doubling down on the meritocratic idea of equality of
      opportunity for all. I now believe even more in the <em>merit</em>
      of meritocracy.</p>
